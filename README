This project is a fighting game with two player or player vs AI options made in C++ using SDL1.2. 
AI can be toggled for player2 by pressing j. 
Attack is done by punching and throwing projectile. 
Defence is taken care by crouching and using hands as shield. 
The game ends when health becomes zero and the loser explodes reappearing only when reset 'r' is pressed.
The images used except cat and bird were drawn by me. 
All non-movement postures of player are relevent to the game and help him avoid specific source of damages. 
Usage of former Indian PM as player makes it more interesting when compared to generic fighting sprites. 
I have also implemented a very touch AI to beat and I am confident that it will be challenging enough for many tries.
